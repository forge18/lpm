# Welcome to LPM Wiki

**LPM - Lua Package Manager**

Local package management for Lua. Because global installs are legacy.

## Overview

LPM provides local, project-scoped package management for Lua, similar to npm, cargo, or bundler. It solves the problem of global package installations that cause dependency conflicts and make CI/CD difficult.
